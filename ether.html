                    <h3>A short production time.</h3>
                    <p>The very short production time (2 months) forced to be efficient with the code, because I
                        wouldn’t have time to do big rewrite it if change in the game design had to be made.</p>
                    <p>As such at the very start of the project, I outlined the great component of our game:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entity with lots of variable logic to handle</li>
                        <li>A freeform construction system that needs to be 100% reliable.</li>
                        <li>Easy to iterate procedural generation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, I chose an architecture inspired by modular pipeline: very atomically made snippets of logic
                        that calls themselves in chains with as few in and out possible.</p>

                    <p>The first thing done was creating the play space.</p>
                    <p>But building it by hand every time we wanted to try a size would have been a loss of valuable
                        time.</p>
                    <p>This script is responsible for procedural instantiation of a grid and all the game components
                        that require the context of the grid</p>

                    <h3>Sculpt System</h3>
                    <p>Second was the only system that needed to rewrite from its original form, note that the vast
                        majority of methods were already written.</p>
                    <p>This system is responsible is a group of different pipelines that makes and destroy walls.</p>
                    <p>To make it scalable in the long-term wall creator was from the get-go written as a library of
                        modular method for each little operation that our walls could carry out.</p>
                    <p>When Sculptor script was rewritten, the only thing that truly changed was the logic of when and
                        how to call the generic WallCreator methods.</p>
                    <p>This flexibility created by forward planning in code allowed us to rework one of our core
                        mechanics in less than an afternoon freeing up resources to improve other aspects.</p>
