                    <h3>Gameplay Programmer</h3>
                    <p>Using the rather limited visual coding of Construct 3, I created and fully customisable wave
                        manger and AI for the enemy.</p>
                    <p>The Wave Manager uses a 3-dimensional array stored in a. Son to encode all information needed to
                        create a wave (the position of each spawner, what to spawn and how much). This. Jason is loaded
                        from browser memory on lunch and then read every start of waves to position everything and then
                        call the function that creates an enemy.</p>
                    <p>The Enemy AI used A*algorithm, where each enemy move as a self-avoiding groups. To achieve this,
                        I need to either:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Recalculate the A* map every frame which would kill performance</li>
                        <li>Overwrite the behaviour which would make enemies behave unpredicted.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So, clearly I needed a better solution. Ultimately, I landed on a mix of both:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Every 0.5 sec we recalculate the map around the enemy far from view, and every frame we do
                            it for the enemy close to the player. Since the player focus on close enemies, we sacrifice
                            a bit of performance to make them responsive.</li>
                        <li>If an enemy overlap another enemy we overwrite the pathfinding with a biased random walk.
                            While overlapping the enemy do not recalculate the A* map to save on performance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Level Design:</h3>
                    <p>After coding it, I also designed every wave manually.</p>
                    <p>Not to go blind I did a lot of play tests to know how different players react and tend to play
                        our game.</p>
                    <p>Using this data, I positioned each wave’s spawner at specific points, creating encirclement or
                        pinch situation for the player, but also creating safe pathway with the grappling hook.</p>
                    <p>This created an experience of a seemingly simple game that is in reality very hard, we wanted to
                        push the player to truly learn each little mechanic and "exploit" we put in the game while
                        making sure the game was actually achievable.</p>
